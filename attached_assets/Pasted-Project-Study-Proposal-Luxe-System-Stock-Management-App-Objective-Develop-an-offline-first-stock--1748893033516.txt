Project Study Proposal: Luxe System Stock Management App

Objective:
Develop an offline-first stock management application for a small-to-medium scale retailer managing diverse inventory, including electronics and fashion items. The app will serve two main user roles: Admin (shopkeeper) and Employee.



Context Overview:
Luxe System is a stock management system built to help shopkeepers better organize, track, and monitor their inventory across different departments. The app is designed to work fully offline to accommodate environments with limited or inconsistent internet connectivity.



Target Users:





Admin (Shopkeeper): Manages products, categories, purchases from warehouse, employees, and reports. Records stock intake and controls inventory.



Employee: Handles product sales and stock movement (in/out).



Core Functional Areas:





Department Selection





After login, users select the department they’re working in (e.g., Electronics, Fashion).



All data shown afterward (products, categories, sales, reports) is scoped to the selected department.



Product Management





Admin can add new products with image, name, price, initial stock, and assign them to a dynamic sub-category under the selected department.



Each product has a unique code (e.g., PHC001 for Phone Cases, WIG001 for Wigs).



Category System





Two-level category structure:





Main Categories / Departments (e.g., Electronics, Fashion)



Sub-Categories (e.g., Cameras, Phone Cases under Electronics; Wigs, Dresses under Fashion)



Both Main Categories and Sub-Categories are dynamic and manageable by Admin.



Purchase Recording (Warehouse Intake)





Admin records purchases made from the warehouse or supplier.



Each purchase includes supplier name (optional), product, quantity received, unit cost, and timestamp.



Total cost per line is auto-calculated (e.g., 20 units × 1000 RWF = 20,000 RWF).



If a product is purchased again at a new unit price, it's tracked as a separate purchase entry for history.



Sales Recording





Employees record product sales, select item and quantity.



Sale records include image, name, unit price, quantity sold, and timestamp.



System adjusts available stock based on the sale.



Stock Movement Tracking





Employees can record stock in/out.



Admin can also record movement from warehouse.



Movements are timestamped and linked to user.



Employee Account Management





Admin creates, updates, and deletes employee accounts.



Assigns roles/permissions (e.g., can sell only, can do stock-in).



Actions by employees are logged and attributed for accountability.



Reporting (Admin Only)





Weekly and monthly summaries:





Total sales



Sales by department and sub-category



Low stock alerts



Top-selling items



Purchase history and spending



Option to export reports to PDF/CSV.
